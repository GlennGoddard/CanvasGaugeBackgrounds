# CanvasGaugeBackgrounds
Canvas Gauge Backgrounds for use in Home Assistant

Home Assistant Lovelace front-end yaml is included as a starting point.
The yaml will need to be modified to match the sensors that your system has.
You will need to install the custom canvas gauge for this to work.
The backgound and logo pictures need to be placed in your 'local'/'www' directory for Home Assistant.

I am in the process of removing wording from the backgrounds and using state-label for text, this will allow any language of your choice.
